        <h4>Impact of Text Messaging on Communication</h4>
        <h5>Written by Heidi Hemmer</h5>
        <p>According to a 2008 study, "Text messaging and other interactive communication make up thirty-one percent of the time college students spend communicating, while listening is fifty-six percent and actually talking is only thirteen percent."<br/></p>
        <p>Text messaging encourages students to avoid face to face communication, this article explains.  However, texting is not the first technology to have this effect.  The radio and other forms of print media had a similar displacement effect.<br/></p>
        <p>"College students use text messaging to multitask. You can text someone as you are brushing your teeth, singing a song, eating food, in class, playing a game, or at work. A convenienve of text messaging is you do not need to answer the text right away."</p>

        <h4>Miscommunication: <br/>The Problem with Texting</h4>
        <h5>Written by Enrico Magnani</h5>
        <p>"Because text messaging cannot accurately convey tone, emotion, facial expressions, gestures, body language, eye contact, oral speech, or face to face conversation, it is likely messages will be misinterpreted or misunderstood. The real meaning of your message gets lost through the medium."<br/></p>
        <p>This article also comments on how tendency can create poor grammar habbits as a result of common texting abbreviations. Texting, if its used as someone's primary mode of communication can also have a negative affect on a young persons interpersonal development and social skills.  The author encourages people to take a few extra seconds and send longer texts so that you can guarantee your message is clearly understood.</p>

        <h2><a href="sc1.html" class="nounderline">Scenario 1: Co-workers set up a meeting</a></h2>
        <span class="left"><img src="style/sc1scene.jpg" alt="example graphic" width="140px"/></span><h3>
          Texting can be used to determine logistics, or arrange details.  Often a message can be created, received, and understood at face value.   Interpretation of emotion is not always necessary for a person to convey information.
        </h3>
        <h2>Image: text is encoded into 1's and 0's, which is how the computer interprets text</h2>
        <p>
          Two coworkers, that have been previously introduced, are discussing the details to set up a meeting and discuss a work-related project.  They are most likely on a team together, or peers in their work environment; one person is not the superior of the other.
        </p>
        
        <h2><a href="sc2.html" class="nounderline">Scenario 2: Mother urges son to apply for internships</a></h2>
        <span class="left"><img src="style/sc2scene.jpg" alt="example graphic" width="140px"/></span><h3>
          A text message can be easily misread, and the meaning changes from sender to receiver.  What was sent as a casual greeting could be read with sarcasm, and a message not carefully worded can become harmful.
        </h3>
        <h2>Image: begins as a structured pattern but it breaks down and becomes broken</h2>
        <p>
          A mother, having not heard from her son in a while, is texting him, inquiring about the status of his internship applications. The mother has brought up this subject multiple times during the son's freshmen year at college, but the son has not yet completed any applications. He has been preoccupied with other things, and is frustrated at his mother who often brings up the son's older brother who has been very succesful at finding internships.
        </p>
        
        <h2><a href="sc3.html" class="nounderline">Scenario 3: Girl borrows her roomate's sweater</a></h2>
        <span class="left"><img src="style/sc3scene.jpg" alt="example graphic" width="140px"/></span><h3>
          The subtle social cues and messages that we send through body language when we are face-to-face are lost with texting. An assumption about another person's feeling might not be correct, and can lead to frequent miscommunications.
        </h3>
        <h2>Image: the initial sunrays in the clouds begin to fade away as a storm brews</h2>
        <p>
          Two roomates are texting each other, following up another conversation they had a little while ago about whether or not they could borrow each other's clothes.  Their opinions were clearly not well communicated in their prior conversation, and both character use abbreviations that imply joking and laughter, when one of them is actually fairly annoyed at the other.
        </p>
        
        <h2><a href="sc4.html" class="nounderline">Scenario 4: Two people arrange their next date</a></h2>
        <span class="left"><img src="style/sc4scene.jpg" alt="example graphic" width="140px"/></span><h3>
          The lack of immediacy with texting allows people to pause and think; a thoughtful response can improve the outcome of an interaction. Removing the stress of public interaction gives people a chance to respond at their convenience.
        </h3>
        <h2>Image: seemingly mixed up sections of black and white shift to create a symbol of balance</h2>
        <p>
          This conversation happens as a follow up to a first date between two people that went well.  Both people are interested in going out a second time, and they are texting to figure out those details but more to get to know each other and find common interests.
        </p>
        <h5>Disclaimer</h5>
        <h5>The characters in each scenario are generalized and can usually be implied from the text messages, but in an effort to be thorough I have listed them above.  The scenarios show a range of how text messaging is used among milennials and the younger generation, and I expect that most college age students would be able to relate to these situations. I felt most comfortable writing texting exchanges that would happen among people that are my age since I am a college student and since the focus of this project is not to represent every scenario in which texting is used.</h5>
